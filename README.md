# Interactive-Book-Analyser
It's a software build using java. This project visualizes \"choose your own adventure\" books as graphs, where each paragraph is a node and each choice is a connection between nodes. We explored different graph algorithms like Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, and Kamada-Kawai. We ended up using the JUNG library to display the graph, since implementing Kamada-Kawai ourselves was too complex.<br>The program can read .json and .txt files and create color-coded graphs based on the type of events. It gives a clear view of the different possible paths in the story.
